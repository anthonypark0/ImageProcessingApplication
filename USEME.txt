Our program supports reading the contents of .txt files to perform commands. As long as the user
inputs a script containing a valie .txt file name, our program will read the contents.
An example being: "asdsa sad Assignment4Text.txt asdas". As long as Assignment4Text.txt is
accessible by the program,the contents will be read.

HOW TO USE : GUI
This program is a graphical program that allows the user to interact with an app like program.
The user needs to upload an image first, either an PPM, PNG, BPM, or JPG.
The user has a scroll option they can use to scroll through the image that they are using. 
Once they upload it, they can save it directly with a new name, as well as choose the image path
through the pop up, or they can use any of the editing/filtering options, which include:
- Blur
- Brighten
- Darken
- Flip Horizontally
- Flip Vertically
- GreyScale
- GreyScale Blue
- GreyScale Green
- GreyScale Intensity
- GreyScale Lima
- GreyScale Red
- GreyScale Value
- Sepia
- Sharpen
The user has the option to layer all of these filters on top of each other prior to saving their
final image. The user also has access to the current edited image as well as the histogram which
show the values for red, blue, green and intensity. However, they cannot do anything with the
histogram. With features like brighten and darken, the user is forced to type in an integer,
which has a value showing how much they would like to brighten or darken the image. If the user
does not input an integer, there will be no effect on the image. If a user tries to apply
a filter or save when an image is not loaded, there will be a pop-up message which does not allow
tells the user that they can not save or filter that image.
Once a user chooses to save, they can assign a name to the image and also select the pathway they
would like to save the file to.
